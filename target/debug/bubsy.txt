What? Nuclear Annihilation? The reason the world will end is alien induced yarnball degradation! Mark my words!
When is this going to be over?
Woolies! HA! You're 24 years too late to catch me.
World hunger... Nuclear proliferation... Reality TV... None of those horrors compare to... Yarn ball deprivation!
